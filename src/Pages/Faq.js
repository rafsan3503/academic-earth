                Academic Earth courses are the equivalent of 10 contact hours.
                Upon successful completion of the course, YALSA will issue you a
                certificate of completion indicating the number of contact
                hours. Since continuing education requirements differ by state
                and school district, so it is best to check with your
                institution as to whether they will accept our contact hours for
                continuing education credit.
